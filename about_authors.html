        <h2>About the Authors</h2>
        <p>This website was created by a group of NLP students from the University of Gdańsk (UG). It is part of our Web Development course project.</p>
        
        <p>The <strong>Linguistic Helper</strong> project aims to make language learning easier by providing users with definitions of words from multiple dictionaries, allowing them to better understand word meanings, usage, and context. By comparing multiple dictionary entries side by side, users can get a comprehensive view of the words they search for.</p>
