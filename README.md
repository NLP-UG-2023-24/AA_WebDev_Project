# Linguistic Helper 🧠📚

**Linguistic Helper** is a web-based application that allows users to look up definitions from multiple dictionaries at once, helping them understand words in a richer, more nuanced way.

## 🌍 About the Project

This project was created by **NLP students at the University of Gdańsk** as part of the **Web Development course**.

Our aim was to build an educational tool that highlights how different dictionaries might define the same word slightly differently—revealing subtle shifts in meaning, usage, or tone.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Type in any English word.
3. Click **Search** to view definitions from various dictionaries.
4. Explore the "About Authors" and "About Website" sections for more context.
